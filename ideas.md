<idea>
  **Design Movement**: **Cyber-Brutalist Executive**
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Authority**: Unapologetic use of bold structures and high contrast to signal confidence and competence.
  2. **Data Transparency**: Visualizing the "messy data to revenue" pipeline through exposed grid lines and monospaced data readouts.
  3. **Precision Engineering**: Every interaction feels calculated and mechanical, reflecting the "Systems Architect" persona.
  4. **Global Scale**: Imagery and layout that feels borderless, using abstract maps and timezone motifs.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deepest Black (#050505)**: The void from which order emerges. Represents the unknown potential of raw data.
  - **Emerald Green (#10B981)**: The signal of growth and revenue. Used strictly for "verified" success and action points.
  - **Gunmetal Grey (#2D3748)**: The structural framework. Used for cards and dividers to provide industrial stability.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Grid**: Breaking the standard 12-column grid to create tension and interest. Content blocks overlap slightly to suggest interconnected systems.
  - **Modular Dashboard**: Sections feel like widgets in a high-end command center rather than traditional web pages.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **The "Revenue Meter"**: A persistent, subtle progress bar that reacts to scroll, symbolizing the journey from lead to deal.
  - **Terminal Blocks**: Code snippets (Python/SQL) used as decorative textures in the background, fading in and out.
  - **Glassmorphic Data Cards**: Frosted glass effects for case study highlights, suggesting clarity emerging from the dark background.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons have a "press" depth; hover states trigger mechanical micro-sounds (visualized via quick color shifts or border expansions).
  - **Data Reveal**: Information loads sequentially, mimicking a system boot-up or data query execution.

  **Animation**:
  - **Staggered Entry**: Elements slide in with a heavy, damped spring physics, feeling substantial.
  - **Glitch Accents**: Very subtle, rare glitch effects on hover for "Tech" elements to emphasize the digital nature.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Plus Jakarta Sans** (Bold/ExtraBold) - Geometric and assertive.
  - **Body**: **Inter** (Regular/Medium) - Highly legible, standard for UI.
  - **Data/Code**: **JetBrains Mono** or **Fira Code** - For the "technical execution" aspect.

  **Design Movement**: **Neo-Noir Corporate**
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Shadow & Mystery**: Using darkness not just as a background, but as a veil that is lifted by the user's interaction (the "Revenue Partner" revealing value).
  2. **Cinematic Narrative**: The site flows like a high-stakes thriller trailer, building tension and releasing it at the "Work With Me" CTA.
  3. **Elegant Efficiency**: Minimalist but rich. No wasted pixels. Every element serves the revenue goal.
  4. **Human-Centric Tech**: Balancing the cold precision of AI with the warmth of human connection (the "Tech vs. Human" duality).

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Midnight Blue (#020617)**: A richer, more complex alternative to pure black, suggesting depth and sophistication.
  - **Neon Emerald (#34D399)**: A glowing beacon in the dark. Used for key insights and "Aha!" moments.
  - **Platinum (#E2E8F0)**: For typography, ensuring high readability against the dark canvas without eye strain.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Cinematic Scroll**: Full-screen sections that snap into place (optional, or just very distinct section breaks).
  - **Spotlight Focus**: The user's cursor acts as a subtle light source, illuminating borders or text as they navigate.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **The "Lens"**: Circular reveal effects on images or data points.
  - **Floating Glass**: UI elements that appear to float above the abyss, casting soft, colored shadows.
  - **Silhouette Imagery**: Professional shots of Timothy or abstract executive figures in silhouette, backlit by Emerald light.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Fluid Discovery**: Content fades in as if emerging from fog.
  - **Magnetic UI**: Buttons and key elements have a slight magnetic pull to the cursor.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slow Burn**: Background gradients that slowly shift and pulse.
  - **Parallax Depth**: Text and background move at different speeds to create a 3D immersive feel.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Space Grotesk** - Technical but with quirky, human details.
  - **Body**: **DM Sans** - Friendly, geometric, and modern.
  - **Accents**: **Syncopate** (Uppercase only) - For labels and tiny details.

  **Design Movement**: **Swiss International Tech**
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Absolute Clarity**: Information is king. The design gets out of the way of the data.
  2. **Grid Rigidity**: A visible, strict grid system that communicates reliability and structure.
  3. **Typographic Hierarchy**: Size and weight do all the heavy lifting. Minimal imagery, maximum impact from words.
  4. **International Style**: Universal symbols and layout patterns that work across cultures (Global Identity).

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Matte Black (#111)**: A flat, non-reflective surface for content.
  - **Signal Green (#00C853)**: Used purely for functional indicators (status: online, revenue: up).
  - **Concrete Grey (#888)**: For secondary information and grid lines.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: The entire site is built on a visible or felt grid. Content fits into boxes.
  - **Split Screen**: Frequently dividing the screen into "Problem" vs. "Solution" or "Data" vs. "Narrative".

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **The "Ticker"**: A running marquee of skills and tools (as requested) but treated like a stock ticker.
  - **Swiss Cards**: stark, bordered cards with massive padding and small, precise text.
  - **Geometric Shapes**: Simple circles and squares to represent data points.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Instant Response**: No fade-ins, no lag. Hover states are binary (on/off).
  - **Micro-Interactions**: Small, precise movements (e.g., an arrow rotating 45 degrees).

  **Animation**:
  - **Transformations**: Elements scale or translate with linear or cubic-bezier ease. fast and sharp.
  - **Marquee Flow**: Continuous, smooth motion for the tool stack.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Helvetica Now Display** (or **Inter Tight**) - The ultimate neutral, authoritative font.
  - **Body**: **Inter** - For pure readability.
  - **Captions**: **Roboto Mono** - For technical specs and footnotes.
